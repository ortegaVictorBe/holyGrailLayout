          <h2>Biography</h2>
          <p>
            Salvador Efraín (Salarrué) Salazar Arrué (b. 22 October 1899; d. 27 November 1975), Salvadoran writer and painter who used the pseudonym Salarrué. A native of Sonsonate, he became the most popular literary figure of mid-twentieth-century El Salvador. After education in San Salvador and at the Corcoran Art Academy in Washington, D.C. (1917–1919), Salazar produced short stories, novels, poems, and paintings that reflected the Salvadoran common people; helped to preserve Salvadoran folk culture; and awakened a social consciousness in the country.</p>
            <p> In the late 1920s he was an important contributor to Alberto Masferrer's Patria, and he continued to be an influential writer and intellectual force in El Salvador until his death in 1975. Rural Salvadoran themes dominate Salazar's major novel, El señor de la burbuja (1927), and his classic collection of stories, Cuentos de barro (1933).
