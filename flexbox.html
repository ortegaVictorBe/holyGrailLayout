          <h2>Biography</h2>
          <p>
            Claudia Lars was a Salvadoran poet and was one of the most outstanding female voices of Latin American poetry in the 20th century. She was talented from childhood and drew early inspiration from the ancient and classical Spanish as well as the romantic English literature.

            A gifted artist, her first booklet of poetry was published when she was only 17 years old, courtesy General Juan José Cañas, one of her early mentors. After completing her education, she fell in love with another poet but the relationship was short-lived as her father made her migrate to the United States. Upon reaching America, she soon got married and started working as a Spanish teacher.
          </p> 
          <p> Later, she returned to her homeland with her spouse and upon her return, she was highly influenced by the company of many contemporary poets and writers. In this new environment, her poetry flowed again with spontaneity and ease which resulted in her first lyrical delivery titled ‘Stars in the Well’.

           It was followed by many other poetry collections which received much appreciation from critics and readers. Gradually, she rose to prominence in the world of Salvadoran literature through the quality of her poetry and was subsequently bestowed with numerous awards for her notable works. Transparent, simple, and marked with a remarkable formal knowledge of verse, her poetry mesmerized the readers and made her one of the most celebrated female poets of her times
