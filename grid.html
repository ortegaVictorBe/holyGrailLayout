          <h2>Biography</h2>
          <p>
            Alberto Masferrer (b. 24 July 1868; d. 4 September 1932), Salvadoran journalist and political figure, most famous for his mínimum vital, a nine-point program designed to provide a minimum standard of living to his countrymen. As a youth Masferrer displayed exceptional sensitivity to the social problems he encountered throughout Central America.
          </p>   
          <p> He objected to the outmoded, restrictive system of education and the appalling conditions in which many Salvadorans, particularly those in rural areas, lived. His basic ideas, present in their most rudimentary form in his first work, Niñerías (1892), were refined over the next four decades.</p>
